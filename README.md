# Hz Convert

A simple command-line script to convert between sine-tone frequencies (Hz), MIDI pitch numbers, and pitch names in scientific pitch notation (e.g. "E-flat 4").

## Usage

The script runs in Python 3 via the command

```bash
python hz_convert.py
```

You will be asked set a reference point for the note A4 (defaults to A4 = 440 Hz) before selecting the type of conversion you want. Specific instructions for each conversion are given after the menu selection has been made.

At any time, type `x` to return to the main menu and `x` again to exit.
